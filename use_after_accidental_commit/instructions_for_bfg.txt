# Herein lie the instructions for implementing the BFG repo cleaner whenever you accidentally
commit/push an unintended file or a file that is too large for the remote repository

# First, we must repack the repository; go to the directory/project environment folder containing the 
.git repository and pass the following command

git gc

# Second, we must pass the BFG command itself; it is as follows

java -jar bfg-1.14.0.jar --strip-blobs-bigger-than 100M .

    # The size of the minimal file can be changed from 100 M and (.) 
    indicates that the .git repository is contained in the present working directory 

# Third, we must pass the following cleanup command 

$ git reflog expire --expire=now --all && git gc --prune=now --aggressive


## Now you are done!
